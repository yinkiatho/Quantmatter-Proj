# LSTM and SMA SPY Trading Algorithm - Stock Price Prediction App
This Streamlit application is designed to help you explore and analyze the historical stock price data of SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust) using a combination of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for stock price prediction and SMA (Simple Moving Average) for technical analysis. You can also assess the performance of a mean reversion strategy based on the LSTM predictions.
